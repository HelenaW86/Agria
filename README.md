# Agria Coding Test
This repository contains my solution for the Agria code test.

## approach
1. Create **React App** with **Vite** and **Type Script**.
2. Data Fetching: **Fetching data** from the **Random User Generator API**.
3. State Management: Manage the fetched data using React's **useState** and **useEffect** hook.
4. Error Handling: Implemented **error handling** to display appropriate messages for failed data fetching requests.
5. UI Design: Using **Styled Components**, ensuring the 
webpage looks clean and responsive.
6. Button to fetch a new random user
7. Loading spinner while data is being fetched.
8. Animation using **Key frame**
 
## chalenges
* Determining the specific types of errors being thrown. 
* Understanding React.StrictMode. It runs 2 times, so the Fetch was made 2 times.  

## Possible improvment
* Error messages.
* The styling can look nicer.

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run **`npm install`**.
4. Run **`npm run dev`** to start the development server.
